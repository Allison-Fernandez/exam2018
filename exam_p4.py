What is the most interesting/funny/cool thing(s) about Python that you learned from this class or from somewhere else.

You can use code or a short paragraph to illustrate it.

"""For me, the most interesting thing was building the nim game in assignment 1. My favorite part about it
was how the program used a combination of user inputs and computer generated inputs. I think that this will be
one of the most useful aspects of python for me in my future career. This summer I was part of a software 
development and testing and I was creating the tests for the program. It consisted of creating combinations of
imputs and the expected output and then testing it against what the program was actually doing. Now, I really
undestand what was going on behin the scenes."""
